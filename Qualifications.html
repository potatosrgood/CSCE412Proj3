        <h3>My Area of Interest and Why</h2>
        <p>While in third grade, I woke up early one Saturday morning. With the rest of my family asleep, my immature self was well aware of the opportunities this brought. 
            I rushed to the living room and put Wall-E, the greatest movie of all time, in the DVD player. While watching, I wondered why the robots in the movie could not
             be real. Robots automatically vacuuming the floor, preparing food, and giving massages all seemed like fantastic things the world could use. What  has always 
             fascinated me, however, is giving machines the ability to think for themselves. Such a technology could have infinite possibilities.</p>
        
             <p>Now far beyond my Wall-E days, I began to consider the greater implications of attaining true artificial intelligence. When the United States used the first 
            atomic bomb during World War II, it left the whole world in shock and even partly led to the Cold War. Artificial intelligence may play the role that nuclear
             weapons do today: an incredible scientific discovery yet also the most catastrophic weapon in existence. In the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a person's FaceBook
              usage data was more than enough to undermine democratic processes. Yet, if used correctly, AI can bring unimaginable benefits to countless aspects of science.
            What started as an idle curiosity while watching Wall-E has ignited my interest forever. I want to learn more about AI and become a force using it for good. As I
            move ahead in my career, I would love to further study and learn about such technology.
