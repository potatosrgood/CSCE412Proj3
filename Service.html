        <h3>The Children's Museum at Houston</h3>
        <p>Through the years 2019 to 2020, I volunteered at the <a href="https://www.cmhouston.org/" target="_blank">Children's Museum</a>. When I was younger, I would go to the museum almost every week and have the highlight of
            my childhood while not knowingly, getting my current interest in engineering. When I got older, I knew that I had to volunteer there as my way to say thanks.

        <h3>JDRF (Juvenille Diabetes Research Center)</h3>
        <p> Throughout the past few years, I also have volunteered at JDRF. They host a walk for diabetes annually which I not only volunteer at but also organize to have some
            of my friends come to volunteer also. On top of that, they also hold an annual ball to raise money for the cause which I also volunteeer for.
