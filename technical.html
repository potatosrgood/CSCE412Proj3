        <h3>Working With ROS and Docker</h3>
        <p>During my internship at <a target="_blank" href="https://nauticusrobotics.com/">Houston Mechatronics</a> (recently renamed to Nauticus Robotics, one of my projects was to make a remote 
        battery charger for the Aquanaut. In the process, I learned both how to work with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and <a href="https://www.ros.org/" target="_blank">ROS</a>. The image below is me (from 2019) next to Aquanaut at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_Buoyancy_Laboratory">NASA's Neutral buoyancy lab</a>.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>For another project, in a reasearch paper where I studied the applicability of machine learning, I wrote a convolutional neural network to detect signature authenticity. The paper can be read  <a target="_blank" href='./attachments/paper.pdf'>here</a>.
        In this process, I learned <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> and polished my skills programming in Python.</p>
